"In Soviet Russia...
        ...target p0wn YOU!"
    -- ancient Russian proverb

This one's a little different. ;-)

You're not trying to p0wn a target--the target is trying to p0wn you!

If you can trick the attacker into thinking he's gained execution on your "system," he might try to mark his conquest with a boastful flag...

Hint: check around for what tools we installed on this system to help you out...
